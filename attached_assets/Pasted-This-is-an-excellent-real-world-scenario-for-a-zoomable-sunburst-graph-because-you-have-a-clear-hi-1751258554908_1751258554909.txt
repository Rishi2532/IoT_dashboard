This is an excellent real-world scenario for a zoomable sunburst graph — because you have a clear hierarchy and multiple levels with statuses. Let’s break down how to map your water infrastructure data to a zoomable sunburst, step by step.

✅ 1️⃣ Your Hierarchy
You already have it:

scss
Copy
Edit
State (Maharashtra)
 ├─ Region (6 regions)
     ├─ Scheme (108 total)
         ├─ Village (1,070 total)
             ├─ ESR (1,376 total reservoirs)
                 ├─ Sensors (Flow, Pressure, Chlorine)
You can stop at any level depending on the detail you want in the sunburst.
For example:

Level 1: Regions

Level 2: Schemes under each region

Level 3: Villages under each scheme

Level 4 (optional): ESRs per village

Level 5 (optional): Sensors under ESRs

✅ 2️⃣ What Should the Sunburst Show?
Possible ideas:

Slice size: Could represent number of schemes, villages, or population.

Color: Could indicate status:

Fully Completed Scheme → Green

In Progress → Orange

Village LPCD > 55 → Blue

Village LPCD < 55 → Red

ESR Chlorine/Pressure levels → Different shades

Sensor Online/Offline → Dot indicator or shading

Zoom:

Click Region → zoom into its Schemes.

Click Scheme → zoom into Villages.

Click Village → zoom into ESRs.

Hover to see details: population, daily LPCD, chlorine, pressure, sensor status.

✅ 3️⃣ How Does This Help?
You can:

Visualize gaps: See which regions have low completion.

Monitor supply: Identify clusters of villages below 55 LPCD.

Trace quality: Drill down to ESRs with low chlorine or pressure.

Check IoT status: See which sensors are offline in a region.

✅ 4️⃣ Technical How-To (Example: D3.js)
Basic steps:

Data format: Hierarchical JSON:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "Maharashtra",
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "Nagpur",
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "Scheme 1",
          "status": "Completed",
          "children": [
            {
              "name": "Village 1",
              "LPCD": ">55",
              "population": 320
            },
            ...
          ]
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Script:

Use D3.js with the partition layout.

Map size to population or count.

Map color to status.

Add onClick to zoom in.

Interactivity:

Tooltip: show completion %, LPCD, chlorine, pressure.

Legend: explain colors/categories.

Breadcrumb: show path like Nagpur > Scheme 1 > Village 1.

✅ 5️⃣ Example Use Cases
Management: One glance shows which regions are underperforming.

Operation: Find ESRs with low chlorine or pressure.

IoT Health: Zoom into sensor-level for connectivity checks.

Reports: Export sunburst as an image for presentations.
