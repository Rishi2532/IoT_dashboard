et’s break down how a zoomable sunburst graph actually works, step by step, in your Infrastructure Monitoring context.

✅ 1️⃣ Basic Principle
A sunburst graph visualizes hierarchical data in a radial (circular) layout:

The center circle is the top-most level (Maharashtra).

The first ring shows the next level (Regions).

The second ring shows what’s inside each region (Schemes).

The third ring shows what’s inside each scheme (Villages).

Optionally, you can keep adding rings for ESRs and Sensors.

So visually, the depth = how far out you go from the center.
And size/color = some property of that node (like population, status, LPCD).

✅ 2️⃣ How Zooming Works
Without Zooming:
All levels are shown at once — the whole tree is visible. If you have hundreds of villages, the outer rings can get very crowded.

With Zooming:
When you click on any slice (e.g., Nagpur Region):

That slice becomes the new root → the clicked part moves to the center.

Only its children are redrawn as new rings.

This filters out everything not related to that branch → declutters your view.

You can keep clicking deeper: Region → Scheme → Village → ESR → Sensors.

Zoom Out:
Click the center or a breadcrumb to go back up the hierarchy.

✅ 3️⃣ How the Data Connects
Each slice is linked to:

Its parent (Region → Scheme → Village)

Its children (Scheme → Villages, Village → ESRs)

Its properties:

e.g., Status (Completed/In Progress) → color.

Population → size.

LPCD category → color shade.

Sensor status → icons or shading.

When you click a slice, the graph updates dynamically to show only that part of the tree, recalculating the new rings and labels.

✅ 4️⃣ How It Helps in Your Case
For Maharashtra’s water monitoring:
✅ At the Region level: you instantly see how many schemes are Completed vs In Progress.

✅ Zoom into Schemes: see which schemes have more incomplete villages.

✅ Zoom into Villages: see LPCD status: Above 55 / Below 55 / Zero supply.

✅ Zoom into ESR/Sensors: check chlorine & pressure health and sensor connectivity.

It’s a clear drill-down from macro to micro: State → Region → Scheme → Village → ESR → Sensor.

✅ 5️⃣ What Happens Behind the Scenes
Under the hood:

The data is structured like a tree (JSON).

A partition layout calculates how to split the circle into slices.

The chart uses angular size (arc) to represent quantity, like village count or population.

Colors are assigned based on status categories.

When you click, the chart animates the focus to the new root — no reload, just smooth transitions.

✅ 6️⃣ Example in Action
Imagine you click:

Pune Region → the circle zooms in, now you see only Pune’s 17 schemes.

Click Scheme 2 → zooms into its villages.

Hover over a Village slice → tooltip shows:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Village Name: XYZ
Population: 1,200
LPCD: 42 (Below 55)
Chlorine Level: 0.3 mg/L (Normal)
Pressure: 0.5 bar (Normal)
See red slices? Those might be Below 55 LPCD.

Click the breadcrumb or center to go back up.

✅ 7️⃣ Why Use It?
🔍 Key benefits:

See big-picture performance at the state/region level.

Drill down to find weak spots (low LPCD, offline sensors).

Very intuitive for non-technical managers.

Easy to integrate into a real-time dashboard.

✅ Putting It Together
In short:

Hierarchy: From Region to Sensor.

Slice size: Number of villages/population.

Slice color: Status (Completed/In Progress, LPCD bands, Chlorine/Pressure level).

Click: Focus on a branch.

Zoom: Explore deeper.

Result: One chart, multiple levels of insight.
