Hey Replit, I need to enhance how chlorine data is stored and queried. Let me explain everything from the beginning:

💾 1. Current System (How It Works Now)
Every day I upload a CSV file.

Each row contains chlorine values for 7 days per ESR.

These are stored in a table with fields like:

chlorine_date_day_1 → chlorine_value_1

...

chlorine_date_day_7 → chlorine_value_7

The database only keeps the latest 7-day record.

That means when I upload tomorrow’s CSV, yesterday’s data gets overwritten.

So there’s no historical record — just a rolling 7-day window.

❌ What I Don’t Like
Because the data is overwritten:

I can’t get a full month's report.

I lose previous values as new CSVs come in.

There's no way to fetch chlorine values for each day in the past, like from 21 May to 21 June.

✅ What I Want to Achieve
I want to change the system so that:

1. All data is stored permanently
Even if dates overlap across different CSVs (which they do), every date + ESR combination should be saved.

2. No duplicate data when querying
Example: if I upload a CSV with 14–20 June today, and 15–21 June tomorrow, then:

15–20 June is repeated in both uploads.

When I fetch data for a full month, I should only get one record per ESR per date.

If a date is repeated, I want the latest uploaded value.

3. Querying by date should work like this:
User selects: From 21 May to 21 June

System:

Scans all records

Looks inside all 7 date fields (chlorine_date_day_1 to day_7)

Picks only those dates within the range

Removes duplicate dates (based on ESR + date)

Returns only the latest value for each date per ESR

🔁 How I Think It Can Work
Keep the current upload format and structure (7-day blocks)

But on the backend, unpack those 7 days into separate rows and store in a new chlorine_history table like this:

esr_id	chlorine_date	chlorine_value	uploaded_at
123	2024-06-14	0.5	2024-06-20
123	2024-06-15	0.6	2024-06-20
123	2024-06-15	0.65	2024-06-21

Then, during queries, the system can:

Filter by date range

Group by esr_id + chlorine_date

Pick the most recent entry per day

✅ Summary
I want to switch from a rolling 7-day table to a historical structure.

I want to keep all data ever uploaded.

I want to allow clean queries like:
“Give me chlorine values from 21 May to 21 June” — and get 1 value per day per ESR with no duplicates.
